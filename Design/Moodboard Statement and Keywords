	This app is for people who want to take going to the gym to the next step. This app will help reach that goal, by helping the user to track their workouts. It includes the workouts of bench press, deadlift, and squats. When they open the app, it is personalized to their schedule, by keeping track of the workouts they have done, and increasing repetitions, and then finally increasing the weight amount they will use, helping them progress properly in their lifting journey. With this app, they wonâ€™t ever forget how far they have progressed, and will stay motivated for the next workout session.
