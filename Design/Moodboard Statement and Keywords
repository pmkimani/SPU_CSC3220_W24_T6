Statement of Purpose
	Many people write New Year’s Resolutions to work out and become healthier. This app will help reach that goal, by helping the user to track, while they are in the gym, their workouts. It includes the workouts of bench press, deadlift, and squats. When they open the app, it is personalized to their schedule, by keeping track of the workouts they have done, and increasing repetitions, and then finally increasing the weight amount they will use, and afterwards increasing the repetitions again. With this app, they won’t ever forget how far they have progressed, and will stay motivated for the next workout session.
